Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are visiting the Site in your capacity as an agent of an organization that has executed a Client Custodial Agreement with MPCVault or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, where there is a conflict between the Client Custodial Agreement and these Terms, the terms of the Client Custodial Agreement control.</p>
<h1 id="arbitration-and-class-action-waiver">Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h1>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>
<p>You and MPCVault agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p>
<p>This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes arising out of or relating to your use of the Site, including claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms or agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p>By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with MPCVault as follows:</p>
<p>Initial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach MPCVault’s Legal Department at <a href="mailto:legal@metaloop.world">legal@metaloop.world</a>. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the MPCVault Legal Department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
<p>Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, MPCVault will pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys&rsquo; fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>
<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California, United States of America. You and MPCVault further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. <strong>YOU AND MPCVault AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties&rsquo; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (&ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="mailto:legal@metaloop.world">legal@metaloop.world</a> with the subject line, &ldquo;ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.&rdquo; The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Site or the effective date of the first set of Terms containing an Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, MPCVault also will not be bound by them.</p>
<p>Changes to This Section: MPCVault will provide thirty (30) days&rsquo; notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Site, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you directly. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Site or sent to you.</p>
<p>Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on &ldquo;Changes to This Section&rdquo; is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Site.</p>
<p>Survival: This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of the Site or any account you may have with MPCVault.</p>
<h1 id="governing-law">Governing Law</h1>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. For claims not subject to arbitration, you and MPCVault agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating any disputes between you and MPCVault arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Site. We operate the Site from our offices in California, and we make no representation that materials included in the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, MPCVault, or any third-party provider as a result of the Terms or use of the Site.</p>
<h1 id="indemnity">Indemnity</h1>
<p>You are responsible for your use of the Site, and you agree to defend (at MPCVault’s option), indemnify, and hold harmless MPCVault and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants, affiliates, investors, service providers, business partners, subsidiaries and agents from and against every claim, liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your violation of any of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; (ii) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (iii) any dispute or issue between you and any third party.</p>
<p>MPCVault reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations) and you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim. If the defense or settlement is assumed by you, MPCVault may at any time thereafter elect to take over control of the defense and settlement of the claim. You must not settle any claim without MPCVault’ prior written consent.</p>
<h1 id="modification-of-these-terms">Modification of these Terms</h1>

Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your agreement to be bound by the modified Terms.</p>
<p>Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the dispute arose. We encourage you to review these Terms frequently to stay informed of the latest modifications.</p>
